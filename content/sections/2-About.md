Shikha didn't just shut Neal out, luckily, but instead continued the conversation. We ended up talking because we had mutual friends so we felt comfortable talking to eachother (thanks Kelvin!). From there on, we just kept talking. Of course as friends but we just felt so comfortable talking to eachother it would feel weird when we would go a day without talking!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/1.jpg", header: "August 25, 2018", subheader: "We first meet in person", content: "Shikha made a trip with her friends to visit Chicago for the first time. She went out with her friends and asked Neal if he wanted to hang out with all of them. That is when they had met for the first time but with all the loud music and such, we didn't really get to talk. It was still a great time so we made plans to hangout while she was still there during her trip!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/2.jpg", header: "August 27, 2018", subheader: "A First Date", content: "Together we shared the joys of the Chicago highlife (Shikha even convinced Neal that they could walk everywhere). Neal met one of Shikha's cousins where they visited one of Chicago's nicest rooftops and then they spent time walking along the riverwalk. A time where they got to talk and really get to know eachother. The date ended but nothing changed, daily texts and facetime calls continued. Our relationship continued to grow into something we both knew was truly special. It was a great first date, Shikha just didn't know it yet :p"
}, { imageFileName: "about/3.jpg", header: "August 2018 - September 2020", subheader: "Long-distance", content: "With us being from 2 different states, we couldn't see eachother as often as most people. For a long time, Neal would try to take trips to New York for conferences to see Shikha on his free time so they could hangout. They would also facetime daily and text daily without realizing really 2 years went by. Neal also forgot to officially ask her to be his girlfriend during this entire time :o"
}, { imageFileName: "about/4.jpg", header: "Somewhere in 2019", subheader: "We became best friends", content: "At this point, if we didn't FaceTime eachother then we would be concerned. I mean we video called eachother every single day. It was clear we were best friends at this point. We even had a conversation about it and it was cool to know we were both on the same page. We soon kind of realized we just happened to be on the same page about almost everything, it's why we enjoy spending time together doing almost anything!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/5.jpg", header: "September 25, 2020", subheader: "Shikha officially becomes Neal's girlfriend", content: "Neal and Shikha took a trip to Boston with their friends. One of the days, Neal took Shikha on a date. Shikha loves the water, so we took a walk along the pier. It was cold outside but totally worth it because when near the pier, Neal was finally able to ask Shikha out officially. Even though they had been seeing eachother for a while, Neal was still nervous to do so and needed motivation from his friends (shout out to Justin, Malav, and Yash). Luckily, Shikha said yes(she had to think about it), and since then it's been nothing but great memories!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/6.jpg", header: "August 28, 2021", subheader: "Coconut Official", content: "After seeing eachother for so long and such, we finally decided to take the next step (in Indian terms) and become Coconut Official! Our parents met and we all got to really talk and know eachother. It was an awesome experience and an extremely happy one at that. Though, Shikha's mom and masi fed Neal so much food that he could barely stay awake even after drinking chai. He thinks he fell asleep with his eyes open so no one noticed :| Still an amazing and blessed day for the both of us!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/8.jpg", header: "November 20, 2021", subheader: "The Proposal", content: "For the longest time Shikha was convinced that Neal was going to propose in November and in Chicago. Well she got half of it right. As a surprise, Neal avoided talking to Shikha so much the weekend of the proposal and drove over to New Jersey with his friends (with some of them flying over). Having her friends and family being ready for the moment as well, everyone made it over to Hoboken, New Jersey. Near the Pier to be exact, since all of our big moments have been near a body of water. Then when she walked over to the Pier with her friends, blindfolded thinking she was going to get on a flight to Chicago, she ended up realizing I was proposing to her right then and there in Hoboken with her friends and family near by. Luckily she said yes, a moment to remember forever!"

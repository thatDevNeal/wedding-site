She went out with her friends and asked Neal if he wanted to hang out with all of them. That is when they had met for the first time but with all the loud music and such, we didn't really get to talk. It was still a great time so we made plans to hangout while she was still there during her trip!"
}, { imageFileName: "about/2.jpg", header: "August 27, 2018", subheader: "A First Date", content: "Together we shared the joys of the Chicago highlife (Shikha even convinced Neal that they could walk everywhere). Neal met one of Shikha's cousins where they visited one of Chicago's nicest rooftops and then they spent time walking along the riverwalk. A time where they got to talk and really get to know eachother. The date ended but nothing changed, daily texts and facetime calls continued. Our relationship continued to grow into something we both knew was truly special."
}, { imageFileName: "about/3.jpg", header: "August 2018 - September 2020", subheader: "Long-distance", content: "With us being from 2 different states, we couldn't see eachother as often as most people. For a long time, Neal would try to take trips to New York for conferences to see Shikha on his free time so they could hangout. They would also facetime daily and text daily without realizing really 2 years went by. Neal also forgot to officially ask her to be his girlfriend during this entire time :o"

We did some hiking, took in the views, and visited some friends and family."

We've been back to visit Toronto and Niagara Falls since then, and have also made it to England and Japan."
